### Website for e-TIC 2018
Developed on hurry, so the stylesheets are a little bit weird, but we're working on that, you may help if you want to.

Special thanks to our beloved staff

### Dependencies

Sadly because of the production time we had to use some bad frameworks, we're trying to remove all the heavy dependencies and probably this will be resolved before the event day.

 - JQuery
 - Font Awesome
 - A schedule template from CodyHouse
